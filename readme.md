GitHub has changed its authentication method,when try to add my Github repo, StackEdit receives http 400 error.

There is a workaround to fix this you can find it here: https://github.com/benweet/stackedit/issues/1755

But after you clear your cookies you have to do this again. 

I write this tampermonky script so it will do this automatically when you need to auth.

## What the script do:

Once you are on the screen asking you to "Grant access to your private repositories," The tampermonky script will add the workaround to console

## How to use it
create a new script copy the code and paste the code there then active the code.
